1. Core Features You’ve Described
From what you’ve outlined, the app needs to handle:
Entities
Portfolios → contain Programs
Programs → contain Demands & Projects
Demands → ideas or requests; can convert into Projects
Projects → initiatives with phases, statuses, PM, etc.
Relationships
Portfolio → Program → Project
Demand ↔ Project (linked when a demand becomes a project)
Lifecycle
Demands & Projects go through defined phases (e.g., Idea → Analysis → Delivery) and statuses (Active, On Hold, Completed, Cancelled).
Roles & Permissions
Users can be:
Admin
Portfolio Manager
Program Manager
Project Manager
Contributor / Viewer
Assignments
Work items (demands/projects) have:
Owner
Project Manager
Team members
Basic tracking
Status changes
Simple metrics (dates, effort, cost — maybe later)
2. Suggested Data Model (high-level)
A minimal but flexible relational model could look like this:
Tables

Users: id, name, email, role(s)
Portfolios: id, name, description, owner_id
Programs: id, name, description, portfolio_id, owner_id
Demands: id, title, description, program_id, phase, status, owner_id, requested_date
Projects: id, title, description, program_id, demand_id (nullable), phase, status, pm_id, start_date, end_date
Phases: id, name, type (demand/project)
Statuses: id, name, type (demand/project)
Assignments: id, project_id, user_id, role
Audit Log (optional but useful): id, entity_type, entity_id, change_type, changed_by, timestamp, details
Key relationships:
Portfolio → Program → Demand/Project (one-to-many)
Demand → Project (one-to-one or many-to-one if multiple projects per demand)
Users link to entities via owner/PM or assignments.
3. Tech Stack Options
Depends on your team’s comfort level:
Option A: Fastest MVP (Low-Code/No-Code)
Frontend/Backend: Retool, Appsmith, or Budibase (internal tools)
Database: PostgreSQL
Auth: Built-in or Auth0
Pros: Weeks not months; easy to iterate
Cons: Less customization in UI/UX
Option B: Full Custom Web App
Frontend: React (Next.js) or Vue (Nuxt.js)
Backend: Node.js (Express, NestJS) or Python (Django, FastAPI)
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL
Auth: Auth0, Supabase Auth, or custom JWT
Pros: Maximum flexibility; easier to integrate with other systems
Cons: More dev time & maintenance
Option C: Hybrid
Backend API + Admin UI in low-code tool, custom UI for end users.
4. Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1 (MVP) — Core entities & CRUD
User authentication & role-based access
Create/view/edit portfolios, programs, demands, projects
Phase & status management
Owner/PM assignment
Basic reporting list views
Phase 2 — Usability & Tracking
Search & filtering
Audit log for changes
Dashboard widgets (active projects, demands by status)
Phase 3 — Nice-to-have features
File attachments
Comments & collaboration
Basic Gantt chart view for projects
API integrations (Jira, Teams, email notifications)
